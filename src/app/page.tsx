        NestJS, Next.js, React, and Node.js are powerful tools for modern web
        development, each serving distinct roles. Node.js is a server-side
        runtime that enables JavaScript execution on the backend, offering a
        non-blocking, event-driven architecture ideal for scalable applications.
        NestJS builds on Node.js, providing a robust framework with a modular
        architecture and TypeScript-first approach, making it perfect for
        developing scalable, maintainable server-side applications. On the
        frontend, React.js is a JavaScript library focused on building dynamic
        user interfaces through its component-based architecture and virtual DOM
        for efficient rendering. Next.js extends React by adding server-side
        rendering, static site generation, and a rich set of features for
        building optimized, production-ready applications. Together, these
        frameworks enable developers to create full-stack applications with a
        seamless developer experience and efficient performance. NestJS,
